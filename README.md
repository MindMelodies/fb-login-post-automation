# fb-login-post-automation

This project provides a base of Python code for automating the process of logging into Facebook and creating a post using Selenium WebDriver.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this code is only a starting point. It doesn't include error handling or the management of two-factor authentication. Before using this code, you should build upon it to include these features and any other necessary enhancements to meet your requirements.

Also, remember to follow Facebook's terms of service, particularly those related to automated actions on their platform. This code is meant for educational and personal use and should be used responsibly.

## Getting Started

To run the code, you need to have Python and Selenium WebDriver installed. Fill the `login_email`, `login_password`, and `post_text` variables with your own data. 

## Two-factor authentication

The current code does not manage two-factor authentication. After running the script, if your account has two-factor authentication enabled, you'll need to manually enter the code in the browser. This process could be automated in a future version of the code or as part of your enhancements.

## Error Handling

This code does not handle potential exceptions beyond basic 'element not found' exceptions with Selenium's `WebDriverWait`. Comprehensive error handling should be implemented to catch and respond to various scenarios that might occur during the execution.

## Future improvements

Some suggested enhancements could include:

- Error handling for different possible scenarios
- Management of two-factor authentication
- Option to schedule posts or post multiple items

Feel free to fork this project and adapt it to your needs. Contributions to improve this code are welcome!
